First I added a project on x code and on git hub
i also went to terminal to add cocoapods by going to terminal and add pod init in the file to create a podfile
in the pod file i added the following
pod 'Firebase/Auth'
pod 'Alamofire'
pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
#pod 'FirebaseFirestoreSwift' //this one is commented out just in case i dont need it
pod 'Firebase/Storage'
pod 'Kingfisher'
then added a project on firebase called PursuitAgram
following the prompts i enabled google analytics using my default account
once done and it created i then go to the setting to add a project by pressing the iOS button.
this will ask for a bundleID and in X code i will copy the BundleID and paste it in the textfield you really dont need anything else
It will prompt me to download googleservices file and i will drag it UNDER my info.plist
this will copy it in my file and a prompt will come up just say yes then back at firebase hit next

then go to terminal and press pod install
 YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR APP AND NOW OPEN IT BACK UP IN XSWORKSPACE
 it will have all the pods installed 
 
then in AppDelelgate
import UIKit
import Firebase

then in AppDelegate func didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
// Configuring Firebase step 2
  FirebaseApp.configure()
  return true
}
