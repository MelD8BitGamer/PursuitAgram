    //we will create 2 different buckets or folders 1. User profilePhotos/ 2. ItemsPhotos/
    //The way we will be saving the photos in the buckets so we need to go buy the user ID. so for instance ItemPhotos/itemId
    //lets create a reference to the firebase storage if you are going to write to that storage you need an instance
    private let storageRef = Storage.storage().reference()//we need the reference part
    //default parameters in Swift ex: userId: String? = nil

        //TIME:11:33am III. So we get an image from the user and we will resize that image and then presenting and then convert the image to data then pass the data over to the firebase function and uploads the data to the firebase storage then we get back a downloaded url then we attach the download file to the userID profile photo
        //step1: Convert the UIImage to data because this is the object we are posting to firebase storage

            photoReference = storageRef.child("UserProfilePhotos/\(userId).jpg")// its basically an append and in the top folder i want to create a subfolder or Child folder to that reference, we can do functions on the folder such as delete but you MUST have the ID in order to do it
        } else if let itemId = itemId {
            photoReference = storageRef.child("ItemsPhoto/\(itemId).jpg")

        //Based on the reference ewe created it is either the item photos or profile photos at this point we convert our image to data//TIME: 11:48 III or 10:33am IV

                        //we have a local image so we take that local image an dconvert it to data and we have metadat. we could have a error if not we have meteada, on the download url has a completion handler if i have an error i sentback to the VC a=with an error if we ar successful then we get a photo and attach it to the item of profile pic.//TIME: 11:53
